## Description
The Weather-Dashboard is built to view current and foreacast weather for the next five days. The design of the website is built using bootstrap. When a user enters a city name the website fetches data from open weather API and the elements are dynamically presented. Major learnings were deeper understanding of API calls, asynchronous aspects of a promise with DOM manipulation.
